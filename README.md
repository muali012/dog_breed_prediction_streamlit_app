# dog_breed_prediction_streamlit_app
This repository contains a model trained on a downloaded dataset to predict different breeds of dogs. By optimizing various hyperparameters, we aim to improve the accuracy of the model. The predictions generated by this model can be valuable for NGOs focused on animal welfare and educational initiatives related to dog breeds.
